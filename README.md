# Open Science MOOC Book Development

This is the official repository for the Open Science MOOC Book.

Anyone can join our [open Slack channel](https://osmooc.herokuapp.com/) and [team on GitHub](https://open-science-mooc-invite.herokuapp.com/) for the whole MOOC project.

## Core content

The content is fully accessible, and can be used for learning purposes, either individually or as a group, and can be shared and re-used as you wish.

This is an example of a book based on R Markdown and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) that we could produce for the Open Science MOOCommunit as a mean of having a portable format to export all the Modules in a single PDF/Book format, making the content available online and offline.

The **Book** has been thought as a way to gather and knit all information from all Modules of the MOOC into portable formats. For this reason, no original content needs to be created for the Modules section of the book. Content for each Module should be taken from the respective repositories. However, supplemental content should definitely be added in the Book if there is no relevant Module that could host it.

You can find the preview of this example at https://opensciencemooc.github.io/book.

# How to contribute 
Main RStudio.Cloud instance that is used to create the Open Science MOOC book using the bookdown package :arrow_right: https://rstudio.cloud/project/427989.

Anyone may access it and play with it for free in addition to not having to set up your own computer to start contributing using RStudio.Cloud. You can use Git/GitHub as well through the terminal within the RStudio instance.

If you want to use it this way and would like to contribute to the project, you have two choices:

1. You may copy the whole repo in Your Workspace to access it permanently by clicking the Save a Permanent Copy button. You'll have to set up your Git credentials sometime.
1. Start a brand new project in your Work Workspace environment by clicking on the little downward arrow (next to  the New Project button) and then click on New Project from Git Repo.
URL for the git repo: https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/book.git

Of course, you can simply clone the repo on your local machine like any other GitHub repo and do your thing.
